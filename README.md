Forecasting financial time series with ARIMA, VAR and a video prediction neural network

#Please note that the neural network, shown in vid_pred_neural_net+.py, has been inspired by the work of Franchesci et al. who have developed a state-space variational autoencoder model for video prediction, named Stochastic Latent Residual Video Prediction, which is presented in their paper:

Franchesci, J.-Y., Delasalles, E., Chen, M., Lamprier, S., and Gallinari, P. (2020). Stochastic Latent Residual Video Prediction. https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09219.

#The code for their model has been provided in the GitHub repository of Edouard Delasalles:

Delasalles, E. (2020). Official implementation of the paper Stochastic Latent Residual Video Prediction. https://github.com/edouardelasalles/srvp.

#Hereby, the idea of treating a financial time series forecasting task as a video prediction problem has been described in the work of Zeng et al.:
